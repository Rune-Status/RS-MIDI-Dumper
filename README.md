# RS-MIDI-Dumper
With this tool, you can dump all the MIDI files from the RuneScape HD or Old School RS cache.

Running Instructions:
1. Simply run the application (Main.java in the project).
2. Click the "File" menu in the application.
3. You can choose to either dump all MIDI files from an Old School RuneScape cache (Using OpenRS), or a RuneScape HD cache (Using my own MIDI dumper for higher revisions).
4. After clicking either option, you'll find a new folder called "MIDI Dump" within the Cache's folder. This will contain the Music tracks (Index 6/Music 1) and Fanfare (Index 11/Music 2) tracks, decoded into MIDI format.
